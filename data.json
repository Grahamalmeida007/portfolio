    "lead": "I’m Graham Fredy Almeida, a Biomedical Engineering Technology graduate from St. Clair College (2025). My technical journey began in my family’s hardware business, where I learned tools, customer care, and practical problem-solving. I’ve since worked across pharmacy, electronics, automotive repair, and biomedical technology, giving me a multidisciplinary perspective that helps me solve challenges creatively. I enjoy the intersection of engineering, healthcare, and innovation—bringing embedded systems, soldering, troubleshooting, and preventive maintenance together to improve patient safety and care standards. I’m seeking roles as a Biomedical Engineering Technologist while progressing toward my long-term goal of becoming a Cybersecurity Biomedical Engineer.",
